<!--The text you are reading right now is comment. Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag.
With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code. Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.
Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors.-->
